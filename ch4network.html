This protocol dictates that each message be broadcast to all the machines on the bus.  Each machine monitors all the messages but keeps only those addressed to itself. To transmit a message, a machine waits until the bus is silent.  IT begins transmitting while continuing to monitor the bus.  If another machine also egins transmitting, both machines detect the clash and pause for a brief random period of time before trying to transmit again.  </li>
                    <li>CSMA/CA wifi: Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance.  Wireless networks try to avoid collisions rather than trying to detect them. Referred to as WiFi.  When collisions do occur, messages must e retransmitted.</li>
