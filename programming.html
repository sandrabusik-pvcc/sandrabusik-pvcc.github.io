    <h1> Chapter 5: Programming Algorithms & Software Testing</h1>

    <h2> Phases of computer program development: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Phase 1: Understand the problem</li>
        <li>Phase 2: Design an algorithm to solve the problem</li>
        <li>Phase 3: Write the program code in appropriate language based on the algorithm</li>
        <li>Phase 4: Enter the program and save</li>
        <li>Phase 5: Execute the program</li>
        <li>Phase 6: Test the program, find errors and debug, then retest</li>
        <li>Phase 7: Decument and evaluate the program</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Programming structures: </h2>
    <ul> 
        <li>Sequential structure: Top-down execution</li>
        <li>Decision structures: if/then/else</li>
        <li>Iterative (Looping):
            <br/>while loop: continue looping as long something is true<br/>
            repeat/until loop: continue looping until something is ttue<br/>
            for loop:loop a given number of times</li>
        <li>Recursive structures:
            <br/>Repeat a set of insturction as a subtask of itself<br/>
            Repetition continues until:<br/>
                degenerative case, which is a termination condition, is met<br/>
                (degenerative case is also called a "base case")
        </li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2> Two classic programming/database problems </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sorting:Descending order/Ascending order<br/>
                sorting number<br/>
                sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values)</li>
        <li>Searching: find specific data that meet a certian criteria<br/>
                In database:<br/>
                    Filters: temporary search<br/>
                    Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated<br/>
        </li>
        <li>Two popular search techniques:<br/>
                Sequential search: search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time<br/>
                Binary search:<br/>
                    only works if data is SORTED first<br/>
                    start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.</li>
    
    </ul>

    <h2> Two classic program goals </h2>
    <ul> <li>Efficiency: Proram takes minimal time and/or resources</li>
        <li>Correctness: Program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions</li>

    </ul>
