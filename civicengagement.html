    <td><h3>Introduction:</h3><p>Marbury v. Madison is the most important case in American constitutional law.  This Landmark case incorporated the Judicial branch into the government’s “checks and balances” fundamental system, which at the time only included the Legislative and Executive branches.  This created a formidable government where no branch could over-assume greater power than the other through appropriate checks incorporated by the others equally to ensure there were no abuses of power as well as balances to correct if one branch began assuming more power than the other.  
    </p><p><h2></h2>During the infancy of our US government, our 2nd US President, John Adams lost the election of a second run to office by Thomas Jefferson.  During the lame duck session of transition, President Adams appointed many Justices siding with his party that were opposed to President Jefferson’s party.  The Senate confirmed these appointees.  Most of these commissions could be delivered before the new governing party took office.  William Marbury was one of the justices whose commission did not get to be delivered before Jefferson’s administration took over.  President Jefferson, through the Secretary of State, James Madison, did not follow through on these last commissions and justified his decision stating that the commission of Marbury and a few others were not delivered under Adam’s administration.  Marbury sued Madison that he should follow through with the commission and be forced to do so.  The Supreme Court of the United States declared its opinion on February 24, 1803.  The Supreme Court established that the US Constitution is actual law, not just delineations of our government as well as the principle of Judicial Review completing the foundation of our overall government set up.  <p><h3>Discussion:</h3>The Supreme Court’s decision was made through the analysis of three questions that Marshall posed.   
<br/>•	1st – Did Marbury have a right to his commission?<br/>
•	2nd – If Marbury had a right to his commission was there a legal remedy for him to obtain it?<br/>
•	3rd- If there is a remedy, could the Supreme Court legally issue it?<br/>
<p>For the first question, Marshall, the chief Justice of the US, determined that all procedures according to the US Constitution were followed for the commission and that the delivery of the commission itself is not included in the legal procedure.  The Supreme Court then decided that it was illegal for Madison to not commission Marbury. </p>
<p>The second question’s answer was that there is a legal remedy for a wrong that is done.  The legal remedy is a writ of mandamus forcing the perpetrator to follow through with the law.  </p>
<p>The third question was handled by reviewing a document Congress had passed called Judicial Act which stated the power of the Supreme Court.  This document created by Congress was ambiguous as to the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction.  The Supreme Court concluded that the document meant that the Supreme Court had jurisdiction over the Marbury case.    However, the Supreme Court observed the Constitution stated the Judicial branch’s jurisdiction.  Article III of the Constitution states that the Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction is for Ambassadors and states.  This did not include dignitaries such as Marbury, so the Supreme Court could not issue any mandate for Marbury to take office.  This contradicted the document construed by Congress.  Because the Constitution has precedence it is supreme and dictates the actual law.  Therefore, the Supreme Court could not issue the writ of mandamus on Madison.</p>
<p><h3>Conclusion:</h3>The Judicial branch can determine if what Congress puts forward is Constitutional or not, thereby establishing the precedent of the third and last component of “Checks and Balances”, Judicial Review. This precedent of Judicial Review allowed the Judicial branch to partake in checks and balances equally to the Legislative and Executive branches.   A thorough “checks and balances”, now including the third equal branch of the US government, impeded any one branch from becoming too powerful.  This case determined that when there is conflict between the Constitution and laws passed by Congress, Constitutional law must be supreme.  The Constitution was written to have a government that prevented the abuse of power. Marshall’s decision in Marbury v. Madison finished a very critical component of our government foundation whereby federal laws can be interpreted and executed correctly.  </p>
